# Multi Pendulum

Originally made for Hackclub's Accelerate!

A physics engine made to showcase the properties of a pendulum in free fall. 
To use, simply add or remove as many links as you would like and change the mass and link values! You may also decide whether or not to include drag/air resistance!

# How to Use

The website for this project is posted on vercel and can be accessed <a href="https://pendulum-lovat.vercel.app/">here</a>!
Alternatively, you could clone the github repo, go into the multi pendulum file and run it from there!
